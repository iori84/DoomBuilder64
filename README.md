# Doom Builder 64
Doom Builder 64 is a custom fork of Doom Builder 2 by CodeImp made to support mapping for DOOM 64 on PC (EX/Steam/GOG), originally developed by Samuel "Kaiser" Villarreal and now maintained by the_kovic. Doom Builder 64 currently doesn't support making maps for the original N64 release of DOOM 64.

## Installation
Doom Builder 64 doesn't ship a traditional installer. To start using Doom Builder 64, simply download a .zip file containing the binaries from the Releases page, extract and launch.
### Requirements
Doom Builder 64 requires **Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5** installed. This should be already installed on the vast majority of computers. If your computer is an exception, consult Microsoft's pages on how to install.

## Building
